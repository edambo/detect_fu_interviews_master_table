    "text": "This page contains tables that summarize the LEAD Assessment Panel Data. The first table summarizes the data without grouping the rows by MedStar ID while the second table provides a summary of abuse determination for each unique MedStar ID.\n\n\nLEAD panels were provided a presentation detailing the voting process and definitions for the various sub types of elder mistreatment prior to convening and then a total of 3 votes occurred per individual abuse case.\n\n\nAt each discussion, a research staff member presented a brief clinical description of each patient to LEAD panel members. Following this description, LEAD panel members were given further time to review the corresponding case materials. Members were then instructed to cast an initial ballot to document their assessment of the global presence of elder mistreatment (“Yes abuse”, “No abuse”, “Unable to determine”). After the first vote was completed, individuals reported to the group their assessment on the presence or absence of EM. If complete agreement was present among members (i.e., all members voting “Yes” or “No”), then consensus was reached and panel members would wait for the research staff member to present the next case, and the process would restart.\n\n\n\nIf one or more panel members voted differently than the other members on the global presence of abuse, panel members were asked to discuss their interpretations of the clinical data presented to them. Members then were instructed to cast another vote using the method previously discussed for vote 1. After vote 2, determination of the LEAD panel for the presence or absence of elder mistreatment was made by a simple majority vote. For example, if at least 3 panel members (out of 5) indicated that no abuse was present at vote 2, then LEAD panel determination was classified as “No abuse” present for that case. If there was no majority, such as in the event that 2 members voted “Yes abuse”, 2 members voted “No abuse”, and 1 member voted “Unable to determine”, then that case was classified as “Unable to Determine”.\n\n\n\nA research staff member would then present a previously redacted overall results from a Structured Social and Behavioral Evaluation (SSBE) of the participant. LEAD panel members were then instructed to cast a third vote. Following Vote 3, individuals were then asked to document the types of abuse present (“Physical”, “Psychological”, “Financial”, “Sexual”, and “Neglect”). This vote reflects the decision by the LEAD panel members after all relevant information is available to them. For each abuse type, the final classification (i.e., “Yes”, “No”, “Unable to Determine”) was made using an identical method to that described above for determining global abuse status after vote 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DETECT tool determination was counted as positive if the value of any of the detect tool variables was ‘Yes’ while the LEAD Panel Assessment was counted as positive if the final determination value was ‘Yes’ for any of the abuse types.\n\n\nLEAD Panel AssessmentDetect ToolpositivenegativeTotalpositive69727796negative000Total69727796\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity100.00 %Specificity0.00 %Prevalence8.67 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessmentUnique ID CountUnique ID Proportion of TotalInitial assessment7981.00Secondary assessment1350.17Post-detect assessment5530.69\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final abuse determination is the result of the majority vote of the secondary assessment (if one was done) or initial assessment (if a secondary assessment wasn’t done).\n\nphysical_abuse_detLEAD Assessment physical abuse determination based on majority vote.VariableCategoryNPercent of N (95% CI)physical_abuse_detNo79099.1 (98.2 -

    "text": "LEAD panels were provided a presentation detailing the voting process and definitions for the various sub types of elder mistreatment prior to convening and then a total of 3 votes occurred per individual abuse case.\n\n\nAt each discussion, a research staff member presented a brief clinical description of each patient to LEAD panel members. Following this description, LEAD panel members were given further time to review the corresponding case materials. Members were then instructed to cast an initial ballot to document their assessment of the global presence of elder mistreatment (“Yes abuse”, “No abuse”, “Unable to determine”). After the first vote was completed, individuals reported to the group their assessment on the presence or absence of EM. If complete agreement was present among members (i.e., all members voting “Yes” or “No”), then consensus was reached and panel members would wait for the research staff member to present the next case, and the process would restart.\n\n\n\nIf one or more panel members voted differently than the other members on the global presence of abuse, panel members were asked to discuss their interpretations of the clinical data presented to them. Members then were instructed to cast another vote using the method previously discussed for vote 1. After vote 2, determination of the LEAD panel for the presence or absence of elder mistreatment was made by a simple majority vote. For example, if at least 3 panel members (out of 5) indicated that no abuse was present at vote 2, then LEAD panel determination was classified as “No abuse” present for that case. If there was no majority, such as in the event that 2 members voted “Yes abuse”, 2 members voted “No abuse”, and 1 member voted “Unable to determine”, then that case was classified as “Unable to Determine”.\n\n\n\nA research staff member would then present a previously redacted overall results from a Structured Social and Behavioral Evaluation (SSBE) of the participant. LEAD panel members were then instructed to cast a third vote. Following Vote 3, individuals were then asked to document the types of abuse present (“Physical”, “Psychological”, “Financial”, “Sexual”, and “Neglect”). This vote reflects the decision by the LEAD panel members after all relevant information is available to them. For each abuse type, the final classification (i.e., “Yes”, “No”, “Unable to Determine”) was made using an identical method to that described above for determining global abuse status after vote 2."

For example, on the 15th of March, they would receive a list of all the people who were treated by MedStar and screened with the DETECT tool between March 1 and March 14. The call center would then call every person on that list and attempt to schedule them for a follow-up interview. Our inital target was 70 of these interviews per month.
